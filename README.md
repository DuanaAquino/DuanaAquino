Hi there! 👋 I'm Duana, a creative soul turned tech enthusiast. After years as a 3D artist, animator, and illustrator, I’ve decided to level up and dive into game development and software engineering. 🎮💻<br>
I’m crafting interactive experiences blending my artistic flair with code. When I’m not learning or building, you’ll probably find me geeking out over games or sketching new ideas. <br>
Let’s create something awesome together! 🚀✨
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to working as a game programmer
- 📫 You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duana-aquino/">Linkedin</a>
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
